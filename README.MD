Getting and Cleaning Data
-------------------------
Course Project
--------------

Requirement:

The requirement is to create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets of data relating to the Samsung Galaxy S,to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Notes:

The source data can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
It is assumed that the contents of this file will be unzipped and place in the current directory.


Running the script:

Running the script below will produce the output file Tidy.txt containing the tidy data set from step 5 above.
e.g.$ Rscript run_analysis.R
